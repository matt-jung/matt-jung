<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Matt</h1>

I'm a second-year undergraduate in Theoretical Physics at Lancaster University, with a keen interest in Quantum Computing and Quantum Information Theory.

Next year, I will be studying at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, taking modules on advanced Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Information, among others. Alongside my degree work, I'm self-studying Mathematical Logic and the Python programming language.
