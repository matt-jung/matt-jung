<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Matt</h1>

I'm a second-year undergraduate in Theoretical Physics at Lancaster University, with a keen interest in Quantum Computing and Quantum Information Theory. I'm currently self-studying [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/learn/).

My projects include:
* A program that takes a given binary string and creates an oracle circuit for Grover's search algorithm, using NOT and MCP (multi-control phase) gates
* A program that generates random binary strings of a chosen length using H gates
