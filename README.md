<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Matt</h1>

I'm a second-year undergraduate in Theoretical Physics at Lancaster University, with a keen interest in Quantum Computing and Quantum Information Theory.

Next year, I will be studying at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, taking modules on advanced Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Information, among others. Alongside my degree work, I'm self-studying Mathematical Logic and the Python programming language.

Outside of my academic work, my main hobbies include weightlifting, ultra running, and reading classical fiction (currently on A Tale of Two Cities by Dickens). I've also had positions on the exec committees of the University's hiking and speleological (caving) societies.Second-year undergraduate in Theoretical Physics at Lancaster University, with a keen interest in Quantum Computing and Quantum Information Theory.
